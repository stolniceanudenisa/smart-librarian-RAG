# Smart Librarian ‚Äì AI with RAG + Tool

Smart Librarian is an AI chatbot that recommends books based on user interests.
It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI GPT and ChromaDB:

- ChromaDB stores short blurbs of books (for semantic search).

- OpenAI GPT selects the best match from candidates.

- Tooling layer (get_summary_by_title) appends the deterministic full summary from local JSON.


Features

- Recommend one book per query

- Retrieve candidates using embeddings + ChromaDB

- Deterministic full summaries (no hallucinations)

- Swagger UI for easy testing

- Guardrails (profanity filter, rate limiting ‚Äì WIP)

- Text-to-Speech (TTS) endpoint to listen to recommendations

- Speech-to-Text (STT) endpoint to send voice queries

- Image generation endpoint to create book covers or scenes

# üîí Guardrails

The app includes a profanity filter that checks user queries before they are sent to the language model.  

If inappropriate language is detected, the request is blocked and the user is asked to rephrase.  

You can extend the bad-words list to cover English or other languages as needed.
